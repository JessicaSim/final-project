      <div class="cell" id="js"><h3>MTA</h3> <p>The MTA doesn't exactly do a very good job of coming on time, and in fact, has the worst on time performance of any rapid transit system in the world. well maybe not the world but right now it's pretty bad. you always have delays blaming it on train traffic or some construction.Then you're always late for work or school which is a pain. What's also annoying is when there's no air conditioning in the subway carts during the summer and half the people feel overheated or want to pass out. But the worse time to take the Subway System is in the  Sometimes you even have to deal with the you always here 'stand clear the closing doors please' and if you live in new york long enough you'll memorize all the announcements 'please stand away from the platform edge' </p></div>
      <div class="cell" id="python"><h3>Public Schools</h3><p>Nothing is worse than going to NYC schools. Not only are schools underpaid, but there's always a shooting two blocks from the school. I'm not even kidding. Students always face the conflict of not having enough resources. Don't have Wifi at home? Well too bad because you still need to do it anyway. It's not like teachers even understand your problems financially. They just tell you to go to a library or stay afterschool and do it.Don't matter if you don't have the time . </p></div>

    <h3>About & Disclaimers</h3>
    <p1>Hello! Thanks for taking the time to read this not-so-good website. This website was made by 2 pretty average highschool students, so please take what we say with a grain of salt. We in no way mean to offend, but this is just our own personal opinion. NYC, despite all of these problems, is a great city and could be much worse than it is now. This website was made in somewhat of a joking matter, though thses issues actually exist. We reccomend that you perform your own research if you want to know more about New York. We did do research, but again, take everything we said here with a grain of salt. Thank you for reading!</p1>
